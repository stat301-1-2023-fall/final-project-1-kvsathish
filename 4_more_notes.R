# More Notes ----
# Stat 301-1

## extra notes for final project ----

# look at how production changes in the postseason (still producing in a high rate)

# quality of team making the playoff

# analyze pts and stats uniquely before the EDA - see if they correlate with each other in any way
# make sure to weigh the variables uniquely
# wins should matter - incorporate it somehow (if team crumbles when they're playing bad)
# analyze games won to games lost
# standardize scores by using z score - avg pts for a year is 18 (divide by and find spread)
# standardize it - do it for every year
# z scores for each year should be standardized 
# score metric will likely look the same in each year - play at least 5 min per game to be considered
# relative to the rest of league, how much better are they?
# get season averages and standard deviation for calculations (be careful about players - make 10 min minimum and at least 10 games)
# 

# do univariate analysis of each variable for the score metric separately - compare to win totals and see if that team is in playoff contention (how good the team was)
# maybe join to see playoff vs. nonplayoff teams
# decide on the score metric and analyze relationship with the other variables
# analyze compared to wins/losses
# break down the playoff games too to evaluate postseason
# expected to have appendix when there's an abundance of analyses - put the not so cool one in the appendix section
# make a good narrative about score and analyzing each component - try the launchpads and ones that bear fruit 
# compare scores to other variables and go from there 
# see how score correlates to turnovers (how adjustment changes score)
# compare to the NBA game score metric
# multivariate - (when, score, turnovers)
# talk about how u came up with score (explain why u picked them) - these are the most important stats that contribute to winning
# five year phases of the career (all started young - after 5 years of experience)
# have a good number of bivariate/multivariate analyses (splitting season/postseason wins / splitting players into phases)
