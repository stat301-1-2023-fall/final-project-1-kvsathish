## Approaching the Central Question

Who should've won the most MVPs?

MVP based on (PRA + Steals + Blocks) / MP - shows who the most impactful player is for how long they played

Separate by regular season and playoffs


This justifies who was the best NBA player from the first fifteen seasons of their respective careers. The 

Do for first five years, and show process will be repeated for next 10 years

## Data Cleaning

In terms of cleaning the data, the `NA` values present in the dataset never factored into the specific variables I plan to manipulate for analysis. Since these specific variables didn't have `NA` values, I didn't eliminate the observations that might have had an `NA` value for a separate variable. Also, I made sure to convert the `MP` variable, representing minutes played, from `difftime` type to a numeric type so my calculated score could be performed with the corresponding data.

## Progress for Project

Kobe Bryant's First Season

```{r}
#| echo: false

kobe_first_year <- allgames_stats %>%
  filter(Date >= as.Date("1996-11-03") & Date <= as.Date("1997-04-20")) |> 
  filter(Player == "Kobe Bryant") |> 
  mutate(Score = (PTS + AST + TRB + STL + BLK) / as.numeric(MP) * 10000) |> 
  select(Player, Date, Score) 

kobe_first_year <- head(kobe_first_year, 5)
kable(kobe_first_year)

kobe_fy_mean <- allgames_stats %>%
  filter(Date >= as.Date("1996-11-03") & Date <= as.Date("1997-04-20")) |> 
  filter(Player == "Kobe Bryant") |> 
  mutate(Score = (PTS + AST + TRB + STL + BLK) / as.numeric(MP) * 10000) |> 
  summarize(Mean_Score = mean(Score))

kable(kobe_fy_mean)
```

Lebron James' First Season

```{r}
#| echo: false

lebron_first_year <- allgames_stats %>%
  filter(Date >= as.Date("2003-10-29") & Date <= as.Date("2004-04-14")) |> 
  filter(Player == "Lebron James") |> 
  mutate(Score = (PTS + AST + TRB + STL + BLK) / as.numeric(MP) * 10000) |> 
  select(Player, Date, Score) 

lebron_first_year <- head(lebron_first_year, 5)
kable(lebron_first_year)

lebron_fy_mean <- allgames_stats %>%
  filter(Date >= as.Date("2003-10-29") & Date <= as.Date("2004-04-14")) |> 
  filter(Player == "Lebron James") |> 
  mutate(Score = (PTS + AST + TRB + STL + BLK) / as.numeric(MP) * 10000) |> 
  summarize(Mean_Score = mean(Score))

kable(lebron_fy_mean)

```

Michael Jordan's First Season

```{r}
#| echo: false

jordan_first_year <- allgames_stats %>%
  filter(Date >= as.Date("1984-10-26") & Date <= as.Date("1985-04-13")) |> 
  filter(Player == "Michael Jordan") |> 
  mutate(Score = (PTS + AST + TRB + STL + BLK) / as.numeric(MP) * 10000) |> 
  select(Player, Date, Score)

jordan_first_year <- head(jordan_first_year, 5)
kable(jordan_first_year)

jordan_fy_mean <- allgames_stats %>%
  filter(Date >= as.Date("1984-10-26") & Date <= as.Date("1985-04-13")) |> 
  filter(Player == "Michael Jordan") |> 
  mutate(Score = (PTS + AST + TRB + STL + BLK) / as.numeric(MP) * 10000) |> 
  summarize(Mean_Score = mean(Score))

kable(jordan_fy_mean)
```

## Reflection

## Next Steps
How to get around the different time periods? Account for point inflation across different years (1st year for Kobe, Lebron, and Jordan) - see avg PPG for each team that the player was a part of

Subtract turnovers from assists

For the fifteen years, maybe do intervals of 3 years to evaluate scores

How to evaluate postseason scores? maybe 1.5x the MVP value
