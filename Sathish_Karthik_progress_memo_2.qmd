## Approaching the Central Question

My central question revolves around which of the three basketball players in the dataset is the greatest basketball player of all time. To approach this question, I've decided to evaluate it by who would have won the MVP the most times between the three individuals. I'm restricting the timeframe to the first fifteen seasons of each player's respective career. This was decided to limit out the longevity arguments for players that have had longer careers than others. Now, I understand that the Most Valuable Player in the NBA is often based on a player's merit as well as team success. To assign the MVP to one of these three players in their first fifteen seasons, I have come up with my own metric score for evaluation.

The MVP will be a much more statistically based award. This is because I will be using a variety of stats reflecting a player's true impact over every single minute played during a season. To measure offensive output, I am including points, assists, and rebounds. For defensive output, I am additionally using steals and blocks. The specific `Score` for each player in a given season will be calculated by:

Score = (Points + Assists + Rebounds + Steals + Blocks) / Minutes Played

Once this score is calculated for each game played in a given season for a player, the average of all the scores in a season will be computed as a final reflection to compare. The greatest final mean score, each season, will justify who should've won the MVP. Then, I plan to add up MVPs for each player and deduce which player is the most valuable the most number of seasons. I believe that this analysis justifies who was the greatest NBA player from the first fifteen seasons of their respective careers.


## Data Cleaning

In terms of cleaning the data, the `NA` values present in the dataset never factored into the specific variables I plan to manipulate for analysis. Since these specific variables didn't have `NA` values, I didn't eliminate the observations that might have had an `NA` value for a separate variable. Also, I made sure to convert the `MP` variable, representing minutes played, from `difftime` type to a numeric type so my calculated score could be performed with the corresponding data.

## Progress for Project

In the following formatted tables, I 

This is for the first year, I'll repeat this process for fifteen seasons

Kobe Bryant's First Season

```{r}
#| echo: false

kobe_first_year <- allgames_stats %>%
  filter(Date >= as.Date("1996-11-03") & Date <= as.Date("1997-04-20")) |> 
  filter(Player == "Kobe Bryant") |> 
  mutate(Score = (PTS + AST + TRB + STL + BLK) / as.numeric(MP) * 10000) |> 
  select(Player, Date, Score) 

kobe_first_year <- head(kobe_first_year, 5)
kable(kobe_first_year)

kobe_fy_mean <- allgames_stats %>%
  filter(Date >= as.Date("1996-11-03") & Date <= as.Date("1997-04-20")) |> 
  filter(Player == "Kobe Bryant") |> 
  mutate(Score = (PTS + AST + TRB + STL + BLK) / as.numeric(MP) * 10000) |> 
  summarize(Mean_Score = mean(Score))

kable(kobe_fy_mean)
```

Lebron James' First Season

```{r}
#| echo: false

lebron_first_year <- allgames_stats %>%
  filter(Date >= as.Date("2003-10-29") & Date <= as.Date("2004-04-14")) |> 
  filter(Player == "Lebron James") |> 
  mutate(Score = (PTS + AST + TRB + STL + BLK) / as.numeric(MP) * 10000) |> 
  select(Player, Date, Score) 

lebron_first_year <- head(lebron_first_year, 5)
kable(lebron_first_year)

lebron_fy_mean <- allgames_stats %>%
  filter(Date >= as.Date("2003-10-29") & Date <= as.Date("2004-04-14")) |> 
  filter(Player == "Lebron James") |> 
  mutate(Score = (PTS + AST + TRB + STL + BLK) / as.numeric(MP) * 10000) |> 
  summarize(Mean_Score = mean(Score))

kable(lebron_fy_mean)

```

Michael Jordan's First Season

```{r}
#| echo: false

jordan_first_year <- allgames_stats %>%
  filter(Date >= as.Date("1984-10-26") & Date <= as.Date("1985-04-13")) |> 
  filter(Player == "Michael Jordan") |> 
  mutate(Score = (PTS + AST + TRB + STL + BLK) / as.numeric(MP) * 10000) |> 
  select(Player, Date, Score)

jordan_first_year <- head(jordan_first_year, 5)
kable(jordan_first_year)

jordan_fy_mean <- allgames_stats %>%
  filter(Date >= as.Date("1984-10-26") & Date <= as.Date("1985-04-13")) |> 
  filter(Player == "Michael Jordan") |> 
  mutate(Score = (PTS + AST + TRB + STL + BLK) / as.numeric(MP) * 10000) |> 
  summarize(Mean_Score = mean(Score))

kable(jordan_fy_mean)

## Reflection

## Next Steps
How to get around the different time periods? Account for point inflation across different years (1st year for Kobe, Lebron, and Jordan) - see avg PPG for each team that the player was a part of

Subtract turnovers from assists

For the fifteen years, maybe do intervals of 3 years to evaluate scores

How to evaluate postseason scores? maybe 1.5x the MVP value
